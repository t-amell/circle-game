## About The Game
Circle-Game is a basic point-and-click game that scores each circle clicked on the screen within the first 15 seconds of the launcher opening

Once the screen pops red, the game is over and the showing score is what you recieved, the game will automatically close after a few seconds on that screen.

If you must leave the game early, go ahead and click the perfectly placed "Quit" button on the bottom of the screen.

The UI is extremely basic (it's my first time using PyGame) as well as this isn't the main portion of the project. The goal is to create an AI algorithm to go ahead and play the game which only necessitates a super basic UI. This will be a future personal project of my so look forward to that, I'll link that in this page when development begins.

## How To Play
I don't currently have a main setup, everything is just found in the game.py file. Move to the directory containing that file within a terminal and use the command 'python game.py' and everything should be smooth sailing from there (be sure to be within the virtual environment as well so the installed packages are found correctly).
